<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>First you need to register the problems for me to judge. You need to do this only once for each problem. All data sent is saved on the <i>local storage</i> of your browser.</p>

<p>Click on the <i>Problems</i> button, input a unique name for the problem. Like, for example, <i>crazy-smart-robot-01</i>.</p>

<p>Then you need to upload a zip file containing the input and output files (the test cases) for the problem. Zip all input and output files using the following structure:</p>

<pre>
    input/
        test00
        test01
        test02
        ...
    output/
        test00
        test01
        test02
        ...
</pre>

<p>You can name the test cases as you wish, but the names must match between input and output files. The files must be in plain text format. Check <a href="sample-in-out.zip">here</a> for a sample .zip file that adheres to the structure above.</p>

<p>Next, click on the <i>Choose Files</i> button to select your zip file or drag and drop the file on the designated area. Then click on the <i>Upload</i> button.</p>
